Code for Unsupervised Multi-Source Domain Adaptation for Regression [1] paper

---

Every experiment was made using CUDA Drivers 9.0 and a Linux machine.
Non GPU users can turn it down by specifying the device to 'cpu'.
To reproduce our environment, one can use  the following line: **conda env create -f environment.yml**

Data for the Amazon experiments can be downloaded and processed by running create_amazon.py
Code also includes **DANN** [2] and **MDAN** [3]. For [3], the code was largely inspired from their original implementation (https://github.com/KeiraZhao/MDAN).
